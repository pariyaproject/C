How long does it take most of us to reach that level of 
human growth, if we ever get there? We get so consumed and diminished, worrying about all the things that need 
improving, we can easily forget to cherish those things that last. Friendship, so rare and so good, just needs 
our care-maybe even the simple gesture of writing a little note now and then, or the dropping of some beautiful 
words in a basket, in the hope that such beauty will be shared and taken to heart.
